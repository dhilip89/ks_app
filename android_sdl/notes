This directory structure corresponds to what is created by Android Studio with all the default/build files removed. Add the Java source files and XML files (AndroidManifest, etc) as appropriate for your project

Library files for ks, sdl and the c++ stl should go in jniLibs:

app/src/main/jniLibs/arch/libgnustl_shared.so
app/src/main/jniLibs/arch/libks_test.so // replace with appropriate name
app/src/main/jniLibs/arch/libSDL2.so

'arch' should be the target architecture (ie armeabi-v7a)

Build/copy the libs into the appropriate locations before building this project with Android Studio.

The names of the library files should match the libraries loaded in the main activity:

app/src/main/java/dev/ks/platform/sdl/KsActivity.java
